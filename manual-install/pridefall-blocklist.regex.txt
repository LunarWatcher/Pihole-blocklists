# Note: this blocklist has massive collateral damage.
# It will take out sites that may otherwise be fine, or may be completely unrelated.
# Additionally, this is a regex-based file to glob in domains and subdomains, as well as ignoring TLDs. 
# The globbing is the reason this will cause collateral damage.
# the Pi-hole dashboard interprets space as the start of a new link, so it should be possible to just
# copy-paste all these into the blacklist, and it'll add them.

# The following regex globs these domains from the tweet: ipgrabber.ru, ipgraber.ru, yip.su, iplis.ru
# Additionally, it eats any and all sites with a domain or subdomain containing "ip". Will likely cause
# false positives.
# Note: this blocks Wikipedia. Don't forget to whitelist it
